# Contributing to ore

Ore is basicallly an ORM which plans to tackle multiple databases configuration in a large scale application where multiple databases, hosts,
readers and possibly caches exist. Goal is to have speed as well as keeping it seemingly abstracted away.

You can contribute by creating issues, or even better yet, submitting PRs. Always around to take a look.
